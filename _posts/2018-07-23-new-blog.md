I completely re-created my blog with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

Jekyll is a static site generator where you can write the content of your sites and posts
in Markdown and compile it to static HTML and CSS. You can use different themes, [Liquid templates](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid), and it even supports Pagination!
It is written in Ruby and super-fast. 

I deploy my site using GitHub pages which supports jekyll natively.
